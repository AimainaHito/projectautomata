Project Automata
================


Current Status
--------------

The Project is still in its initial stages.
Currently the goals are improved cloud generation, airship mechanics as well as settlement generation.


Installation
------------

Compiling Project Automata requires a (ideally recent) version of the ncurses library to be installed.
To compile simply run `make` in the project's root directory which will compile to a binary named `automata`.
